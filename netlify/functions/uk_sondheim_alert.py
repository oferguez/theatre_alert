    Args:
        current (list): List of current event dictionaries.
        upcoming (list): List of upcoming event dictionaries.

        str: The formatted email body as a string.

    Netlify serverless function handler.

    Fetches, processes, and formats Sondheim event data, returning the result
    as an HTTP response.
